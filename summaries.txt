A study analyzing 16,979 arXiv papers on large language models (LLMs) from 2018 to 2023 reveals key trends: 

* A 20x growth in research on societal impacts of LLMs
* Increased participation from non-NLP fields and Asian universities
* Decreased industry publication share and limited international collaboration
* A need for open-source models, interdisciplinary collaboration, and educational resources to promote responsible AI development.


This article provides an overview of Large Language Models, covering recent developments, innovations, and applications, to facilitate further research in the field.


This paper surveys Large Language Models (LLMs), a type of AI that excels in natural language tasks. LLMs are trained on vast text data, enabling human-like language understanding and generation. The paper reviews prominent LLMs, techniques, and challenges, discussing their capabilities, applications, and future research directions, highlighting their potential as a fundamental component of general-purpose AI agents.
